Just walked out of the theater after watching The Monkey and honestly, I’m feeling like a cocktail of emotions, but the bartender who made it was drunk. First off, who knew a movie called The Monkey would leave me questioning the universe and the meaning of life itself? Well, okay, maybe not the universe... but definitely bananas. 

The whole thing starts off kinda quirky, and I was like, “Oh cool, a monkey doing monkey things.” But then it gets weird, and I mean like, the bizarre flavor of ice cream that makes you question your childhood choices. There was one part—no spoilers—but it involves a banana, a shoe, and what might have been a metaphor for capitalism? Not too sure. I laughed, cringed, pondered my own existence... and then the monkey did something totally bananas again!

> At some point, it hit me: am I here to watch or to judge? Not sure if The Monkey is a movie or a very elaborate prank by the director, daring us to find meaning where there’s just... monkey business (sometimes literally). 

The cinematography though, that was like a kaleidoscope made by a toddler. Colorful, chaotic, but somehow fitting? Like, not all art has to make sense, right? Does this make me deep or just confused? Cue the existential crisis.

Oh, and the soundtrack! A bit like my Spotify shuffle when I've had too much coffee—jazz here, odd techno there—unexpected combos that somehow work? Or maybe they don’t, and my standards have been warped by reality TV. Honestly, my brain feels like it’s doing a hula hoop dance while I’m trying to nap.

int bananaCount = 0;
while (dreaming) {
    bananaCount++;
    if (sitThroughAnotherMetaphor(bananaCount) == 42) {
        break;
    }
}

In terms of acting, I guess the monkey is now my spirit animal? Is that a thing? And why did I get attached to a digital primate more than half the humans in the last movie I watched? Amazing or sad, who knows? 

But would I recommend downloading this film or watching it in theaters? Maybe... if you’re into confused feelings and cinematic monkeyshines (credit where it’s due), this might just be your jam. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to seriously rethink my banana consumption.
